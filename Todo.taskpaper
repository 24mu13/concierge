Business:
	- schedule the workflow
		- check the current dates on the dropbox archive to discover the time the new issues are published on the web site.
	- test the wait state
	- add error handling and retry policy
	
Make it production-ready:
	- logging
	
Ideas:
- IFQ: move old issues to S3
	- monitor Dropbox usage and move stuff when the usage is above 90%
