# Concierge

A Slack bot to handle boring and repetitive stuff.

Here's few examples:

 * Download the latest issue from the [il Fatto Quotidiano](https://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it) website and store it in a Dropbox folder (requires a valid subscription to the newspaper).
 * Fetch the [Toggl](https://toggl.com) summary from the latest working day, and post it to Slack channel.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

 * [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com) — this may require you to install Node.js depending on how you plan to install Serverless, see the [Serverless Framework Getting Started](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/) page for more details.
 * [Python](https://www.python.org) 3.7 — all the code is written in Python.
 * [Pipenv](https://pipenv.kennethreitz.org/en/latest/) the so called "Python Dev Workflow for Humans"
 * An [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) account — the bot is a serverless application using Lambda, Step Functions, and other services.
